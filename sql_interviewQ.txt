SECTION 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is SQL?
It is a structured query language, used to perform certain operations on databases.
A Database is a collection of organized data which is stored, accessed and managed electronically.

SECTION 2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL is categorized into 5 types: DDL, DML, DQL, DCL and TCL.

DDL : Data Definition Language
consists of SQL commands that are used to define the database structure or schema(blueprint/skeleton).
DDL is used to create and modify the structure of database and not the data.
CREATE, ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE.

CREATE 		: used to create the database and it's objects like, tables, views, functions/procedures 			and triggers.
ALTER	 	: used to alter the structure of DB, tables, etc.
DROP	 	: used to delete databae or it's objects like tables, etc.
TRUNCATE 	: used to delete all the records from a table and free the space containing the table.

DML : Data Manipulation Language - 
DML has SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data present in the database.
DML commands are not auto-committed that means they can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.

List of DML commands: 

INSERT: It is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE: It is used to delete records from a database table.

DQL : Data Query Language - 
used to fetch data from DB and perform queries on the data. used to retrieve data having some relation and order in it.
SELECT	: used to fetch data according to some condition given in the query.

DCL : Data Control Language - 
consists of SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. 
DCL includes GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

List of  DCL commands: 

GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.
REVOKE: This command withdraws the userâ€™s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

TCL : Transaction Control Language - 
TCL commands are used to manage the changes made by DML statements. Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. TCL commands are used to control the execution of a transaction.

COMMIT: is used to save all the transaction-related changes permanently to the disk.
SAVEPOINT: It marks and saves the current point in the processing of a transaction.
ROLLBACK: command is used to restore database to original state since the last COMMIT.

SECTION 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL DATATYPES - MySQL :

Data types are used to represent the nature of the data that can be stored in the database table.

DataTypes maily divided into 3 types:
String Data types
Numeric Data types
Date and time Data types

STRING datatype:
1. CHAR(size) - Its size can be 0 to 255 characters. Default is 1. it is a String that can contain, 			numbers, letters and special characters.

2. VARCHAR(size) - A String that can contain numbers, letters and special characters. Its size can be from 		0 to 65535 characters.

3. BLOB(size) - It is used for BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). It can hold up to 65,535 bytes.

# More String DataTypes on - https://www.javatpoint.com/sql-data-types

NUMERIC datatype:
1. INT(size) - also, INTEGER(size). It is used for the integer value. 

2. FLOAT(size, d) - It is used to specify a floating point number. size parameter specifies the total number of digits. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified by d.

3. DOUBLE(size, d) - It is a normal size floating point number. Its size parameter specifies the total number of digits. The number of digits after the decimal is specified by d parameter.

4. BOOL - It is used to specify Boolean values true and false. Zero is considered as false, and nonzero values are considered as true.

DATE and TIME datatypes:
1. DATE - It is used to specify date format YYYY-MM-DD.

2. DATETIME(fsp) - It is used to specify date and time combination. Its format is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. fsp is the fractional seconds precision. 

3. TIMESTAMP(fsp) - It is used to specify the timestamp. Its format is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. Its supported range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC.

4. TIME(fsp) - It is used to specify the time format. Its format is hh:mm:ss.

5. YEAR - It is used to specify a year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four digit format from 1901 to 2155, and 0000.

SECTION 4 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL Operators:
**	Exponentiation operator
+, -	Identity operator, Negation operator
*, /	Multiplication operator, Division operator
+, -, ||	Addition (plus) operator, subtraction (minus) operator, String Concatenation operator
=, !=, <, >, <=, >=, IS NULL, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN	Comparison Operators
NOT	Logical negation operator
&& or AND	Conjunction operator
OR	Inclusion operator

SECTION 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL CONSTRAINTS:
Constraints are the rules that we can apply to the type of data in a table. That is, we can specify the limit on the type of data that can be stored in a particular column in a table using constraints. 

1. NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
2. CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
3. DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
4. UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field. there can be multiple unique constraints 		defined per table.
5. INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
6. PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table. values cannot be NULL, A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields.
7. FOREIGN KEY - comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. 
Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

Q. What is Primary Key, Foreign Key? [ refer section 5 - points 6,7 ]

SQL KEYS:
Q. What is Unique Key?
A unique key is a set of one or more than one fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in a database table. It is like primary key but it ALLOWS one null value. There can be many Unique key but only one primary key per table.

Q. What is Candidate Key?
Keys which are used to identify rows uniquely. So, A primary key is a candidate key.

Q. What is Composite Key?
A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table.  It may be a candidate key or primary key.

Q. What is an Alternate Key?
Alternate Key is a candidate key which is not part of primary key.

SECTION 6  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL JOINS:
The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL database based on a related column between the two.

There are 4 main JOINS:
1] INNER JOIN - Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join.

2] LEFT JOIN - Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table.

3] RIGHT JOIN - Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.

4] FULL JOIN - Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or right table.

# LEFT OUTER join, RIGHT OUTER join and FULL OUTER join are same as LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and FULL JOIN.

5] SELF JOIN - a table is joined to itself based on some relation between its own column(s). Self-join uses the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN clause and a table alias is used to assign different names to the table within the query.

6] CROSS JOIN - When each row of the first table is combined with each row from the second table, it is known as Cartesian join or cross join.
After performing the cross join operation, the total number of rows present in the final table will be equal to the product of the number of rows present in table 1 and the number of rows present in table 2.
E.g. table1 has 2 rows * table2 has 3 rows = resulting table has 6 rows.
